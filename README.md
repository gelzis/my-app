## Car Rental Debugging Challenge

CityDrive Rentals is a small Next.js app that lists cars, lets users filter the fleet,
and calls a local API route for inventory data. The UI is intentionally simple, but
there are a couple of bugs to fix.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Tasks to complete

- Make the app run.
- App should show a car list, ensure all UI filters work individually and update the results correctly.
- Users must be able to fill the reservation form and get reservation number
- Make `npm run lint` pass.
- Make `npm run test` pass.

Good luck!
